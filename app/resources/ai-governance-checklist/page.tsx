Each template includes clear instructions, success criteria, and accountability frameworks to ensure effective implementation.</p>

      <h2>AI Governance Framework Overview</h2>
      <h3>Framework Architecture</h3>
      <p>The AI governance framework operates across five integrated stages that ensure comprehensive oversight from initial planning through continuous monitoring. This end-to-end approach provides multiple checkpoints and feedback mechanisms to identify and address potential issues before they impact operations or compliance.</p>
      <h4>Core Principles:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accountability</strong>: Clear ownership and responsibility for AI decisions and outcomes</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Explainable AI systems with documented decision-making processes</li>
        <li><strong>Fairness</strong>: Systematic bias detection and mitigation across all demographic groups</li>
        <li><strong>Robustness</strong>: Reliable performance under diverse conditions and potential attacks</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Data protection throughout the AI lifecycle</li>
        <li><strong>Human Oversight</strong>: Meaningful human control and intervention capabilities</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Governance Stages</h3>
      <h4>1. Planning & Strategy</h4>
      <p>The foundation stage establishes business justification, resource allocation, and initial risk assessment. Key activities include developing the business case, conducting preliminary risk analysis, and securing necessary resources and executive commitment.</p>
      <h4>2. Development & Testing</h4>
      <p>The technical implementation stage focuses on model development, data governance, security testing, performance validation, and bias assessment. This stage ensures technical robustness before deployment consideration.</p>
      <h4>3. Compliance & Review</h4>
      <p>The regulatory alignment stage conducts comprehensive reviews across ethics, legal compliance, privacy requirements, and regulatory obligations. All applicable standards and regulations are verified before deployment authorization.</p>
      <h4>4. Deployment & Approval</h4>
      <p>The production readiness stage validates technical infrastructure, secures business and executive approvals, and executes controlled deployment with appropriate safeguards and monitoring systems.</p>
      <h4>5. Monitoring & Management</h4>
      <p>The operational excellence stage maintains continuous oversight through performance monitoring, compliance verification, incident management, and systematic improvement processes.</p>
      <h3>Decision Points and Feedback Loops</h3>
      <p>The framework includes critical decision gates at each stage that prevent progression until specific criteria are met. Feedback loops enable continuous improvement and rapid response to emerging issues, regulatory changes, or performance degradation.</p>
